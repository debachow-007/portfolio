                <h3>Customer Churn Prediction</h3>
                <h2>Machine Learning</h2>               
                <p>
                This project uses Python with libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, 
                and scikit-learn to analyze and predict customer churn. It begins by loading 
                a dataset and performing exploratory data analysis through various 
                visualizations. Data encoding and splitting are carried out, and two 
                machine learning models, Logistic Regression and Random Forest, are 
                trained and evaluated for customer churn prediction. The project's 
                primary goal is to understand and predict customer churn patterns.

                <h3>Credit Card Fraud Detection</h3>
                <h2>Machine Learning</h2>
                <p>
                    This project is for fraud detection in financial transactions. 
                    It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and 
                    model training. Several machine learning models, including 
                    logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and 
                    K-nearest neighbors, are trained and evaluated. The project 
                    aims to identify fraudulent transactions and reports model 
                    performance metrics such as accuracy, classification reports, 
                    and confusion matrices.

                <h3>Movie Genre Prediction</h3>
                <h2>Machine Learning</h2>
                <p>
                    This is a text classification project focused on predicting movie genres 
                    based on movie titles and descriptions. It involves data preprocessing, 
                    encoding, and TF-IDF vectorization of text data. Several machine learning 
                    models, including Gaussian Naive Bayes, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic 
                    Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest, 
                    are trained and evaluated for genre prediction. The models' performance 
                    is assessed with accuracy scores, classification reports, and confusion 
                    matrices. The project aims to automate genre tagging for movies, and the 
                    trained models can be saved for future use.

                <h3>Packet Flow Visualizer</h3>
                <h2>Computer Network</h2>
                <p>
                    Project Completed as part of Cisco Virtual Internship using Cisco Packet Tracer
                    The objectives of the project could be divided in two parts:
                    <br>i. Creating a network topology to suit the needs of a college network
                    <br>ii. To collect packets at each device using a packet sniffer
                    <br><br>Details about the project:
                    <br>The entire network is divided into 4 parts: CS Lab, Library, Board room and Director's office.
                    <br>The IP addresses are a part of a Subnet with network id 192.168.10.0/26.
                    <br>The devices are connected within their LANs with a Switch.
                    <br>The LANs are connected with Routers using RIPv2 protocol.
                    <br>Sniffers are used in a few places to capture and analyse packets from different nodes.
                    <br>Relevant information can be extracted from the packet headers, noting changes mainly in the Ethernet and IP headers.
